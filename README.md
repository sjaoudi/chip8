# Chip 8 Emulator/Interpreter
This is my implementation in C of an emulator for the CHIP-8 interpreted programming language. It was commonly run in the 70s on the RCA COSMAC VIP computer. There are many implementations of classic video games that are fun to play. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8 for a technical description of the virtual machine.
